# Running Rank Prediction

## 🏃 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the **ranking of runners** in races using machine learning models. By analyzing historical race data, the model identifies patterns and provides rank forecasts. Such predictions can help athletes and coaches strategize for better performance.

## 📊 Features & Workflow
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning and structuring raw race data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding key factors affecting race rankings.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating relevant features for more accurate predictions.
- **Model Training**: Implementing regression/classification models to predict rankings.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assessing model performance using metrics such as accuracy and RMSE.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python 🐍
- Pandas, NumPy (Data Manipulation)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Machine Learning)
